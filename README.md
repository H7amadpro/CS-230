The Gaming Room is a client that developed a game application, "Draw It or Lose It," initially for Android platforms. This game is inspired by the classic television game show Win, Lose or Draw, where teams compete to guess images drawn from a large library of stock images. The client wanted to expand this game to multiple platforms and requested a comprehensive software design document to guide the development of a web-based, multi-platform version. This document would detail the architecture, platform evaluation, memory management, and security considerations required to make the game scalable and accessible to a broader audience.

In developing this document, I particularly excelled in the platform evaluation and recommendations sections. I thoroughly analyzed the capabilities of Linux, Mac, Windows, and mobile platforms, providing The Gaming Room with clear insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each option. I also emphasized a modular, distributed system architecture to support scalability, which I believe will greatly aid future development and deployment across platforms.

The process of working through the design document helped me to structure my thoughts and plan the application in a systematic way. By breaking down each requirement and addressing them in sections, I had a clear roadmap that made the coding process more organized. It also helped me anticipate potential challenges related to memory, storage, and cross-platform compatibility, which are easier to address in the planning stage rather than during development.

If I could revise one part of my work, I would enhance the user experience (UX) considerations section. While the technical specifications are thorough, I think adding more details on responsive design, accessibility features, and UI elements could provide greater insights for the development team. In future projects, I would focus on integrating more UX guidelines into the software design document to ensure the game is accessible and engaging for all players.

I interpreted the user's needs by focusing on real-time functionality, scalability, and cross-platform compatibility, which are essential for a seamless multi-user experience. The Gaming Room required the game to be accessible on various devices while maintaining fast, responsive gameplay. Addressing these needs directly in the software design ensured that technical decisions aligned with the user’s expectations. Considering the user’s needs is vital, as it guides the design process to create a product that is not only functional but also enjoyable and accessible.

My approach to designing the software involved a combination of systematic platform evaluation, architectural design patterns, and security planning. I broke down each requirement and mapped it to a technical solution, making sure to include industry-standard best practices. In future projects, I would continue using modular design patterns and include more prototyping or user testing phases early on to validate design decisions. This would ensure that the application aligns with user needs and technical requirements from the outset.
